							<h1>Deciphering Big Data</h1>
							<h2>Introduction to the Deciphering Big Data module</h2>
							<hr />
							<p>The University of Essex Online Provide the following information on the module:</p>
							<h3>Module Outline and Learning Objectives</h3>
							<p>
								In this module, we will explore the diversity of different data types, sources and methods of data collection. You will also develop an understanding of the process of data wrangling from collection to publishing and the ability to identify resources to undertake the data wrangling process. These processes are essential because it improves the quality of data by transforming the data collected in the raw state to a more usable format for a variety of applications by eliminating unnecessary duplications and redundancies of data items through processes such as cleansing and normalisation. 
					
							</p>
							<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
							<p><b>The module will:</b>b></p>
							<ol>
							<li>Introduce and review various concepts of big data, technologies, and data management to enable you identify and manage challenges associated with security risks and limitations. </li>
							<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies and tools in problem solving. </li>
							<li>Explore different data types and formats. Evaluate various data storage formats ranging from structured, quasi structured, semi structured, and unstructured formats. We explore the various memory and storage requirements.</li>
							<li>Critically examine various data collection methods and sources. Review fact finding methods to determine the integrity, reliability and readiness of data extracted and presented for pre-processing, cleaning, and usage.</li>
							<li>Examine data exploration methods and analyse data for presentation in an organisation. Critically evaluate data readability, readiness, and longevity within the data Pipeline. Examine cloud services, API (Application Programming Interfaces) and how this enables data interoperability and connectivity.</li>
							<li>Examine and analyse the ideas and theoretical concepts underlying DBMS (Database Management Systems) Database Design and Modelling.</li> 
							<li>Explore the future of use of data and deciphering by examining some fundamental ideas and concepts of machine learning and how these concepts are applied in various methods in handling big data. </li> 
							</ol>
							<p><b>In order to:</b>b></p>
							<ol>
							<li>Identify and manage challenges, security issues and risks, limitations, and opportunities in data wrangling.</li>
							<li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.</li>
							<li>Design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments using relevant programming paradigms.</li>
							<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
							</ol>
